Official Oliver's MCSM Armor's Mod repository!

Mod Link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/olivers-minecraft-story-mode-armors

In the Code Section, we will provide the lastest version for each version, 1.18.2, and 1.19.2

Pull requests will not be used.

Issues will be used, to submit suggestions and bug reports.

We currently have no plans for the future of this mod, but will continue to provide texture and regular bug fixes.
 
 
Some things I want to know:

 - Are the armors too OP?
 - Should we make anything harder or easier?
 - Recipe changes (Provide a recipe suggestion using: https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca )
 - Better way of getting enchanted diamonds other than smelting?
 - Much more involving the mod mechanics
