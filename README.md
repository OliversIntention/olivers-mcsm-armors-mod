Official Oliver's MCSM Armor's Mod repository!

In the Code Section, we will provide the lastest version for each version, 1.18.2, and 1.19.2

Pull requests will not be used.

Issues will be used, to submit suggestions and bug reports.

Future plans for the mod:

- Halloween update will be 1.5
- 1.5 will add the White Pumpkin armor!
- 1.5 will be a huge bug fix update!
- 1.5 is planned to include a better way to get Enchanted Diamonds!
 
 - Season 2 Armors will be some time from now, but we will be doing them.
 
 
Some things I want to know:

 - Are the armors too OP?
 - Should we make anything harder or easier?
 - Recipe changes (Provide a recipe suggestion using: https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca )
 - Better way of getting enchanted diamonds other than smelting?
 - Much more involving the mod mechanics
